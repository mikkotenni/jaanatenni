## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Commands

### Install Dependencies
While in your project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies.

```npm install```

### Start the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:

```npm run dev```
This command will start a local development server, usually at http://localhost:3000, and open your default web browser to this URL. You'll see your new React app running. The Vite development server provides features like hot module replacement, which will automatically update your application in the browser as you edit the source files.

### Build for Production
When you're ready to build your app for production, you can use:

```npm run build```
This command tells Vite to bundle your app into static files optimized for production in the dist directory.

### Preview the Production Build
To preview your production build locally, you can run:

```npm run preview```
